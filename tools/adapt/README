adapt - solver for differential equations which determine the full set of
discretization coefficients in adaptive logarithmic discretization approach
in numerical renormalization group

Copyright (C) 2008, 2009 Rok Zitko


adapt solves the differential equations which determine logarithmic
discretization coefficients in the form

  epsilon(x) = g(x) Lambda^(2-x),
  Epsilon(x) = f(x) Lambda^(2-x),
  
where epsilon(x) are the discretization mesh points and Epsilon(x) the
representative energies, while x=j+z is the mesh parameter which combines
the discretization interval number j=1,2,3,.. and the twist parameter z in
the interval [0:1]. For more details see

  renormalization group methods", Computer Physics Communications (2009).

1. Usage

Usage: adapt [P|N] [parameter_file]

Optional argument P or N specifies whether positive or negative frequency
part of the density of states is being discretized [default is "P"].

Argument parameter_file specifies which file contains parameters [default is
"param"].

Consult the sample parameter file for description of the parameters
(in test/tools/adapt).
