nrgchain - tridiagonalisation code for determining the tight-bidning
coefficients of the Wilson chain for NRG calculations

Copyright (C) 2008, 2009 Rok Zitko


nrgchain determines the coefficients xi (hopping constants) and zeta
(on-site energies) for a Wilson chain. It takes the output from adapt
as its input.


Usage: nrgchain [parameter_file]

Consult the sample parameter file for description of the parameters
(in test/tools/adapt).
