- using occupation number representation
- in recalcop[]: m should contain conserved quantum numbers (q,s,p, etc),
  while the lists should contain those additional quantum numbers that
  drop out of the problem
- argument 'r' is totally useless (dirpdt)
- each symmetry comes with a corresponding test in nrgljubljana/tests/models. Not all functionalities
  are tested, though.
